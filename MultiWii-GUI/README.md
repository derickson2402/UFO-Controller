# MultiWii Configuration GUI

This is a copy of the experimental GUI configuration program for MultiWii flight controllers.
You will need to install [Processing](https://processing.org/) on your computer, and then install the library ```controlp5``` by going into Processing under ```Sketch >> Import Library >> Add Library``` and searching for it (you can find help on their [GitHub](https://github.com/sojamo/controlp5) page).
When finished, you may need to restart Processing before launching ```MultiWiiConf.pde```.
See [MultiWii.com](http://www.multiwii.com/software) for help using the GUI.
