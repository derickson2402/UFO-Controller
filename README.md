# UFO-Controller

This summer, we want to build custom racing drones. Eventually, we'd like to hook up FPV cameras, GPS units, and some other fun gizmos so that we can do cool stuff like FPV racing, autonomous path following with GPS, and smart object detection and wayfinding using computer vision.

Right now everything is in very early stages, so check back later for more!
