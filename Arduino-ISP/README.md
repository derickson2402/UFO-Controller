This submodule is for using an Arduino Uno to program an Arduino Nano, for instance if the usb port is blocked on the Nano or both Arduino's are in the same circuit.

Follow the instructions in the ```Arduino-ISP.ino``` file, or check out the link [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/pmwiki.php?n=Tutorial/ArduinoISP). The ```Arduino-ISP-Diagram.jpg``` is taken from the site.
